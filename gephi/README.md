# Gephi projects

All gephi projects are included in this folder.

Brief explanation of the subfolders:
- [citations](/citations): Project created with the clean dataset ([nodes](../datasets/cit-HepTh-nodes.csv) and [edges](datasets/cit-HepTh-with-dates.csv)). This contains the overall statistics of our entire network.
- [citations-cycles](/citations-cycles): Old project that used the original [dataset](../datasets/cit-HepTh.txt), with duplicates and cycles.
- [citation-reduced](/citation-reduced): Here we use the reduced dataset created in [exploring-nodes-with-modularity.ipynb](../exploring-nodes-with-modularity.ipynb) for visualisation purposes.
- [dynamic](/dynamic): Temporal analysis of our network.
